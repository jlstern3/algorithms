// 1. Create a function that returns an array with multiple of 3 up to 999 (pg 28)

// 2. Implement a function that accepts two non-negative integers as arguments 
//ex: lastDigitAtoB(a,b) should return the last digit of the first number (a) raised to an exponent of the second number (b)
//pg 43

// 3. Given an array and an additional value, insert this
// value at the beginning of the array. Do this
// without using any built-in array methods. (pg 52)

// 4. Given an array, index, and additional value, insert
// the value into the array at the given index. Do this
// without using built-in array methods. You can
// think of PushFront(arr,val) as equivalent to
// InsertAt(arr,0,val).

// 5. RemoveAt
// Given an array and an index into the array,
// remove and return the array value at that index.
// Do this without using any built-in array methods
// except pop(). Think of PopFront(arr) as
// equivalent to RemoveAt(arr,0).

// 6. PopFront
// Given an array, remove and return the value at
// the beginning of the array. Do this without using
// any built-in array methods except pop().

// 7. Reverse Array
// Given a numerical array, reverse the order of the
// values. The reversed array should have the same
// length, with existing elements moved to other
// indices so that the order of elements is reversed.

// 8. Remove Negatives
// Implement a function removeNegatives() that
// accepts an array and removes any values that
// are less than zero.
// Second-level challenge: don’t use nested loops.

// 9. Skyline Heights
// You are given an array with heights of consecutive buildings in the city. For example, [-1,7,3] would
// represent three buildings: first is actually below street level, second is seven stories high, and third is
// three stories high (but hidden behind the seven-story onbe). You are situated at street level. Return an
// array containing heights of the buildings you can see, in order. Given [1,-1,7,3] return [1,7].

// 10. Binary Search
// Given a sorted array and a value, return whether
// that value is present in the array. Do not
// sequentially iterate the entire array. Instead,
// ‘divide and conquer’, taking advantage of the fact
// that the array is sorted.

// 11. Min Of Sorted-Rotated
// You will be given a numerical array that has first
// been sorted, then rotated by an unknown
// amount. Find and return the minimum value in
// that array
